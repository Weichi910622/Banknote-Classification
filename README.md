# Banknote-Recognition with M032KG
- Recognizing banknotes with neural network
- Using three photoresistors to measure light intensity corresponding to RGB values. (Each photoresistor is covered with a translucent filter : red, green, or blue.)

## Machine Learning
- Use MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) as the model architecture.

## Operating Principle
### ðŸŽ¨ Color Sensor
- Most colors can be represented as a combination of Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B).
- Each photoresistor is covered with a translucent color filter (R, G, or B), allowing it to sense the intensity of that specific color.
- The analog signal generated by the photoresistor is converted into a digital value via the ADC, representing the light intensity of R, G, or B.

## Steps
1st. `Initialization`:\
Perform an initial scan of the ADC values from the three RGB photoresistors to establish the baseline ambient light levels and continuously monitor the ADC.\
2nd. `Start Detection (Start of Recording)`:\
Occurring significant change about RGB photoresistor values, meaning that a banknote has been inserted and we start recording the variations in RGB intensity.\
3rd. `Exit Detection (End of Recording)`:\
Second significant change occurred, the banknote has passed through, and the ambient light has returned to the baseline, stop recording and finalize the RGB time-series data.\
4th. `Data Resampling`:\
Resample the recorded time-series data to a fixed temporal length to ensure consistency in model input.\
5th. `Banknote Recognition`:\
Predicting the denomination of the banknote.\
6th. `Result Display`
